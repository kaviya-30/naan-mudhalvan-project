ABSTRACT
This paper presents the development of a speech-to-text transcription system that incorporates noise robustness to improve accuracy in real-world environments. Traditional speech recognition systems often struggle to deliver high-performance transcription when exposed to noisy or reverberant conditions. To address this challenge, our proposed system integrates advanced noise suppression techniques and deep learning models designed for robust speech processing.

The system leverages a combination of noise reduction algorithms, including spectral subtraction, Wiener filtering, and deep neural networks (DNNs), to clean input audio before feeding it into the speech-to-text engine. Additionally, a custom-trained recurrent neural network (RNN)-based model, specifically a long short-term memory (LSTM) network, is employed to further enhance transcription accuracy by learning temporal dependencies in the speech data.

We evaluate the performance of the proposed system in various noisy scenarios, such as background chatter, machinery noise, and echoic environments, using standard speech corpora. Results show a significant improvement in transcription accuracy, with lower word error rates (WER) compared to conventional speech recognition systems without noise adaptation. This research demonstrates that integrating noise-robust speech processing techniques can make automated transcription systems more reliable and effective in diverse real-world settings.

The proposed system offers potential applications in diverse fields such as transcription services, voice-controlled assistants, and automated customer support systems, especially in environments with high levels of background noise. Future work will focus on further optimizing the system's performance through additional noise training data and real-time adaptation to dynamic acoustic environments.
